# Social Media Walking Prediction Model
This application was developed for my final year developmental project.

This repository is currently just an original push of the files from my server (with changes to database files for security).
Look at my to-do list below to see possible future changes.

The website is intended to display the potential of a web-based walking prediction model using social media geo-location data.

The results of the project can be read in “The Development of a Walking Prediction Model using Social Media data, in the Field of Crime Analysis” (http://www.timcoysh.co.uk/Tim_Coysh-Dissertation.pdf).
