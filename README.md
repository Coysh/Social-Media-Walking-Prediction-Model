# Social Media Walking Prediction Model
This application was developed for my final year developmental project.

The website is intended to display the potential of a web-based walking
prediction model using social media geo-location data.

The results of the project can be read in “The Development of a Walking Prediction Model using Social Media data, in the Field of Crime Analysis” (http://www.timcoysh.co.uk/Tim_Coysh-Dissertation.pdf).
